/**
 * Ponder configuration for Arc.
 *
 * Reorg handling — Ponder's hardest problem on other chains — is free here. Arc has
 * deterministic single-slot finality under Malachite BFT and zero reorgs, so there
 * is no rollback path to get wrong.
 *
 * What is not free is the RPC. See `src/transport.ts`: the public endpoint sheds a
 * quarter of requests and caps `eth_getLogs` at 10,000 blocks.
 *
 * `startBlock` is the deployment block, never genesis. Arc is past 54 million
 * blocks at roughly half a second each; a genesis backfill would sweep years of
 * unrelated history to find nothing.
